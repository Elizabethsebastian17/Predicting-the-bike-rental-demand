# Predicting-the-bike-rental-demand
Bike-sharing systems have become a popular mode of urban transportation, with thousands of people using them daily. Understanding and predicting bike rental demand is essential for system operators and city planners to improve user experience, optimize bike distribution, and manage resources efficiently. This project aims to develop a machine learning model that can accurately forecast bike rental demand, specifically focusing on usage patterns influenced by weather, seasonality, and time of day. By analyzing a rich dataset of bike rental records, we aim to identify trends and factors that can support decision-making in bike-sharing system management and enhance the overall user experience.
